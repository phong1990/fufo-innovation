# The project objective is making a low cost prototyped Quadrocopter system with a restricted resource and evaluates its flight capability both indoor and outdoor. To some extent, the project will also include some aspects of Filtering technique and vehicle control method to determine what is the best achievable solution for this type of UAV without increasing the budget for development. #
